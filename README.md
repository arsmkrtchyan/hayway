## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Driver trip rating checklist

Use these steps to confirm that a company driver can rate passengers after finishing a trip:

1. **Finish the assigned trip.** Ensure the trip has `driver_state` set to `done` via the "Finish" action in the driver/company trip page.
2. **Open the accepted passengers block.** On the trip details page for the assigned driver, open the list of accepted passengers and click **Rate**.
3. **Submit stars and a note.** In the rating modal, pick 1–5 stars and an optional comment and submit; the client calls the `/api/driverv2/trips/{trip}/rate-user` endpoint for each passenger.
4. **Validate server rules.** The API accepts the request only when the caller is the `assigned_driver_id`, the trip is finished, and the passenger was accepted on that trip; otherwise it responds with `403`/`422`.
5. **Check the result.** Successful submissions return `{ data: { status: "rated" } }` and update the passenger’s aggregate rating the same way as the web driver flow.
